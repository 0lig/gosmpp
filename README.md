# gosmpp
Golang Smpp (3.4) Client Library, porting from [Java OpenSMPP Library](https://github.com/OpenSmpp/opensmpp). 

This library is tested well with several SMSC simulators:
- [smpp-smsc-simulator](http://www.voldrich.net/2015/01/11/smpp-smsc-simulator/): simulates a SMSC server â€“ server which accepts SMS messages and handles its delivery to the mobile phone.
- [SMPPSim](http://www.seleniumsoftware.com/downloads.html): a SMPP SMSC simulation tool, designed to help you test your SMPP based application. SMPPSim is free of charge and open source.

## Installation
```
go get -u github.com/linxGnu/gosmpp
```

## Usage
Please refer to [Communication Test Case](https://github.com/linxGnu/gosmpp/blob/master/test/Communication_test.go) for sample code. If you are familiar with [OpenSMPP](https://github.com/OpenSmpp/opensmpp), you would know how to implement it easily.

TODO: more sample codes and test cases added in next minor version
